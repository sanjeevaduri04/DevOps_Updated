 Ansible is a configuration management tool
 Recently it was acquired by redhat

Configuration Management (CM) has two methods:-
-----------------------------------------------
- PULL BASED CM: Nodes initate the communication to the CM Server
- PUSH BASED CM: CM server will initiate the communication to the nodes.

- Ansible is a push based tool
- Chef is a pull based tool

PUSH BASED CM (Configuration Management)
In PUSH BASED CM, CM Server has admin credentials of the node and the details like ip adress/hostname to login and execute the declarative configuration.

- 
Ansible:-
--------

- Ansible is a push based CM.
- Ansible maintains the list of nodes to be communicated and is referred as inventory.
- To write the declarative configuation, Ansible used YAML and calls it as Playbook.

 Ansible requirements:-
 ---------------------
 - Configuration Management Server in the case of ansible can be very light weight machine.
 - Ansible logs in to the nodes and executes the declarative configuration & for that it requires python to be installed on the node.

Approach:-
--------
- Make a note all the manual steps for deploying the application.
- For each step find the command and convert that into declaration (Module).
