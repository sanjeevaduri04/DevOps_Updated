 Ansible is a configuration management tool
 Recently it was acquired by redhat

Configuration Management (CM) has two methods:-
-----------------------------------------------
- PULL BASED CM: Nodes initate the communication to the CM Server
- PUSH BASED CM: CM server will initiate the communication to the nodes.

- Ansible is a push based tool
- Chef is a pull based tool

PUSH BASED CM (Configuration Management)
In PUSH BASED CM, CM Server has admin credentials of the node and the details like ip adress/hostname to login and execute the declarative configuration.

- 
Ansible:-
--------

- Ansible is a push based CM.
- Ansible maintains the list of nodes to be communicated and is referred as inventory.
- To write the declarative configuation, Ansible used YAML and calls it as Playbook.

 Ansible requirements:-
 ---------------------
 - Configuration Management Server in the case of ansible can be very light weight machine.
 - Ansible logs in to the nodes and executes the declarative configuration & for that it requires python to be installed on the node.


Ansible Approach:-
-----------------
Find all the manual steps to deploy application
Group steps into some common activity and consider this for playbook.
For each manual step create a task and find the right module of ansible.

Lets install an application which runs on tomcat server:-
-------------------------------------------------------
I need a linux server
  - Ubuntu 20.04
Then execute the following commands

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk -y
sudo apt install tomcat9 -y
wget https://referenceapplicationskhaja.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/gameoflife.war
sudo cp gameoflife.war /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/
sudo systemctl restart tomcat9.service

Lets figure out modules

- apt in ansible.
- wget in ansible.
- cp in ansible.
- systemctl in ansible 

---------------

Is a data definition/expression format.
The data which we define is name & value pairs
YAML File Extension => .yaml or .yml extension
Refer Here for the official docs
Structure of ansible playbook

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---
- name: <describe your playbook here>
  tasks:
    - name: <what this task is about>
      <module>:
         <module-parameter-1>: <module-value-1>
         ..
         <module-parameter-n>: <module-value-n>
         state: <value (present)>
    - name: <what this task is about>
      <module>:
         <module-parameter-1>: <module-value-1>
         ..
         <module-parameter-n>: <module-value-n>
         state: <value (present)>

         --------------------------------------------------------------------------
         
 Lets create a user called as devops with password as devops on both Anisble control Node and Node-1 and Node-2
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Do the setup on each server 
* enable password authenticat
* create a devops user
* add this user for sudo permissions without prompting for password.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- sudo apt update
- sudo apt install software-properties-common
- sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
- sudo apt install ansible -y
- ansible --version

Now lets create a inventory file called as hosts

In Ansible we can execute the activity by using

  adhoc command:
   - Can execute any ansible module
   - Good for rare activities
   - history cannot be maintained

    Ex:-
    --
       Adhoc command:
        - ansible -m <module-name> -a <parameters&arguments> -i <inventory> all
        - module-name => ansible.builtin.file
          arguments:
          state argument: touch
          path: /tmp/1.txt
        - ansible -m ansible.builtin.file -a 'path=/tmp/1.txt state=touch' -i all

Playbook: declaring the whole deployment as a yaml file
   - Good for automating activities used multiple times (frequently)
   - Playbook can be version controlled, so we will have history of all of the changes done.

   Ex:-
   --
 ---
- name: learning playbooks
  hosts: all
  become: no
  tasks:
    - name: create a empty file
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: /tmp/1.txt
        state: touch


Manual Steps:-

- sudo apt install tomcat9 -y
- wget https://referenceapplicationskhaja.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/gameoflife.war
- sudo cp gameoflife.war /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/
